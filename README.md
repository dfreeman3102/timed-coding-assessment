# timed-coding-assessment
Fourth bootcamp challenge, using what we have learned in class and outside research to make a timed coding quiz.
 It must have a start button, that when clicked starts a timer and sets the first question. 
 After answering wrong, time is deducted, and a next button is displayed for the next question.
 When the timer reaches 0 or you answer the final question, the game is over and you can input your initials and display your score.

 Outside research includes watching different Youtube tutorials and looking up questions on places like stack overflow.

 Here is a screenshot of the finished project.
